# Purpose of This Repository
This repository documents basic usage of Reactor (https://projectreactor.io/) and is meant to be my personal "Reactor Knowledge Center" in the long term. It does not claim to be fully covering all possibilities with Reactor, nor to be built up didactically or methodically correct. Nevertheless it might help other programmers to get started with Reactor too. But be aware that there are plenty of other much more better resources which you can check out:
* [Official Website](https://projectreactor.io/)
* [Official API](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api)
* [Hopping Threads and Schedulers](https://spring.io/blog/2019/12/13/flight-of-the-flux-3-hopping-threads-and-schedulers)

# Upcoming
* Description of different ways to create and consume streams
* How to work with Threads
* Difference between Cold and Hot sequences
